My favorite editor is Visual Studio Code because of its easy to access user interface, extension availability, and its built in terminal. With its easy to access UI one can organize, edit, create, and access multiple files at the same time which facilitates work such as web design. In addition to this, the editor provides syntax checkers and suggestions which not all editors such as Sublime Text provide. With a simplistic UI, the editor has a very gentle learning curve so newer users can adapt quickly to it.

Visual Studio Code allows users to download extensions to facilitate shortcuts for specific languages as well as provide users with new set of tools to facilitate their working process. One of the most useful extensions I have used is the live share extension, which allows users to create a virtual room where they can share and edit code with others. In addition to this, Visual Studio Code provides multiple extensions that are language specific. These extensions provide users shortcuts for certain programing formats and facilitates the programming process, as well as allow computability with certain languages such as Assemblyx86.

The built in terminal in Visual Studio Code allows users to carry out commands to test their code. In combination with the extensions, users are able to carry out commands that they otherwise cannot in other editors. Simple editors can access, edit, and run files. However in Visual Studio Code, users can get extensions that can run simulations of their code which is useful when creating websites and other tasks.
